# Algorhitms-DataStrucures
Here you will find my implementaions of different Algorithms and Data structure in C and C++


# Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

# Find Minimum Coins Change

Given a value V, the algorithm will exchange V using the minimum amount of coins needed. It will receive an array with all coins available as well as the V to be exchanged.

# Queue data structure

A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

# Stack data structure

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.
